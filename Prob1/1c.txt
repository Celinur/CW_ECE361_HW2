//Question
What is the Big O() for the algorithm that sums the rows and columns in your
application? Explain why. You do not need to include the code that fills the
array form the user input in your calculation.

//Answer
Let n be the number of items in an array.
A nested "for" loop would give us a notation of O(n^2). Here, we have two
nested "for" loops that run for a total of five times each, O(n^2) + O(n^2),
simplifying to 2*O(n^2). Then, we have two more "for" loops that run on linear
time, O(n). That would give us O(2n) in total. Now, we drop the constants
because they become less significant as n gets big. Combining all the for loops
in this program, it becomes O(n^2) + O(n). But Big O also takes into the
account the highest order of n, so the Big O() notation that sums up the rows
and columns in the code is O(n^2).
